This is a shopping cart app using a real-time Firebase database, so that changes can be made amongst multiple people in a household.
This app is a demo for an app that I created for my family members in my household.

Previously we were using messages on whatsapp or notes on our phones to create shopping lists. 
The messages were difficult to track and edit and the notes on our individual phones could not be shared. 

I created this so that all household members could go to the site and add it to their homescreens. 
Icons and the app opening screen were created with the use of favicons and site.webmanifest files. 

For the project I used HTML, CSS and JS. 
To enable sharing and editing the shopping list to update across all devices, I used a real-time Firebase ðŸ”¥ database. 

The app allows for entries to be made and displays them out through the use of flex-box and using the flex-wrap properties. 
Once an item is added it can be clicked on to remove the item from the list and the database. 
To add an item the user can either push enter on their phones keyboard or click an add to cart button.
